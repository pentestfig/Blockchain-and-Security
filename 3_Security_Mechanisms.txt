#Basic Security Mechanisms

##Public Key Cryptography

	+ Also called asymmetric cryptography
	+ There is two keys:
		- Public key: used for encryption.
		- Private key: used for decryption. 	
	+ Public keys are stored in digital certificates. 
	+ Digital signatures: information is digitally signed with private key and confirmed with the public key of users. 
	+ Encryption: Information is encrypted with public key of a user and decrypted with private key of the person. 
	+ Benefits of using digital signature:
		- Authentication
		- Non-repudiation
		- Integrity
	+ Benefits of using encryption:
		- Confidentiality
		- Integrity
		- Authenticity


##Elliptic Curve Cryptography

	+ Alternative to RSA. 
	+ Security through elliptic curves between key pairs for public key encryption. 
	+ As secure as RSA, requires less computational power since it has smaller key sizes.
	+ Side-channel attacks, twist-security attacks are weaknesses. 


##Hash Function

	+ Taking arbitrary length of input and converting it to a fixed length output.
	+ Irreversible.
	+ Size depends on the hash function used.
	+ Even tiny changes in input will cause a significant change in output. 
	+ Commonly used, SHA-256, MD5.
	+ Provides integrity. 

##Hashing and Cybersecurity

	+ Salting: adding random data to password before hash process. This makes it more difficult for hackers to get password.

###Secure Hash Algorithm

	+ A family of cryptographic functions. Consists of: an algorithm consisting bitwise operations, modular additions, compression functions.
	+ Examples: SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA3.
	+ A hash is generated that looks nothing like input.


###IP Security Architecture Components

	+ Encapsulating Security Payload(ESP): Offers integrity, encryption, anti-replay, authentication and payload authentication.
	+ Authentication Header(AH): Offers integrity, anti replay, does not have encryption. Does not protect the information security. 
	+ Internet Key Exchange(IKE): Designed to swap encryption keys dynamically and find a way between 2 devices through the Security Association(SA.
	+ Encryption Algorithm: A document that describes how various encryption algorithms are used. 
	+ Authentication Algorithm: Document that describe how various encryption algorithms are used for AH. 
	+ Key Management: A document that describes key management schemes.
	+ Domain of Interpretation(DOI): Contains the value that other documents need to relate to each other. 


#Advanced Cryptographic Encryption


##Advanced Encryption Standard(AES)

	+ One of the most commonly used symmetric block cipher algorithms worldwide. 
	+ Its purpose is to override the DES algorithm due to its vulnerabilities. 
	+ Three different key weights: AES 128, 196, 256 bits. Each of them has 128 bits block size. 
	+ Governments and military use it. 

###AES Algorithm
	
	+ It's a block cipher in which all data is encrypted in blocks. 
	+ Each block is 128 bits in length. 
	+ Same key is used to encrypt and decrypt. 
	+ 128 bit key: 10 rounds, 192 bit key: 12 rounds, 256 bit key: 14 rounds.

##Triple Data Encryption Standard(3DES)

	+ It uses DES three times. 
	+ Now there are better options to use than 3DES.

	
##Blowfish 

	+ A symmetric block cipher.
	+ 8-byte fixed data block size. 
	+ Its key ranges from 32 to 443 bits.
	+ It is fast and considered to be safe. 
	+ With a proper key size, it can be protected against brute force attacks. 
	+ Free for all applications. 


##Twofish Encryption

	+ Also a symmetric block cipher.
	+ 128 bits block size. 
	+ Accepts key of any length up to 256 bits.
	+ Fast on both 32-bit and 8-bit CPUs (smart cards, embedded chips etc.).
	+ Edged out by new AES.
 

#Other Security Mechanisms

#Digital Signature

	+ It's substitution for a handwritten signature. 
	+ Detail of an electronic record used for authentication. 
	+ The signature is invalidated if a document is subjected to fraudulent alteration. 
	+ Guarantees protection against falsification. 
	+ Unable to repudiate the signature attached to a document. 
	+ Some digital signature algorithms are: RSA-PSS, ECDSA, Ed25519 and so on.


#Multisig Authorization

	+ Unless all the necessary private keys are provided, transactions will not take place. 
	+ Losing or getting one key compromised doesn't mean the compromise of account. 


##RSA Algorithm

	+ A asymmetric cryptographic method that is commonly used to protect data. 
	+ Two separate mathematically related keys are created by RSA: one public and one private. 
	+ Private keys must be kept private. 
	

##Message Authentication Code

	+ Everyone can see the message.
	+ Provides authentication but not secrecy. 
	+ Sender and receiver share the same key. 


##Digital Certificates

	+ It's issued by a third party (certification authority, CA) that proves identity of the sender to the recipient and vice versa. 
	+ It contains: Holder's name, serial number, dates for expiration, public key of the certificate holder, digital signature of issuing authority. 


##Zero Knowledge Proofs

	+ Without revealing any additional details, "Prover" may prove that a certain assertion is valid to the "Verifier".
	+ Completeness: If the argument is valid and all users follow the law, without any outside support, the verifier will be persuaded. 
	+ Soundness: the verifier would not be persuaded in either case if the assertion is incorrect.
	+ Zero-Knowledge: All knowledge outside the assumption that the argument is true or false would not be open to the verifier.
	+ Advantages are:
		- Simple: Does not require any sophisticated system of encryption.
		- Secure: Does not require to report some kind of details. 
	+ Disadvantages are: 
		- Lengthy: There are around 2k calculations.
		- Imperfect: Messages sent to prover/verifier can be destroyed or changed. 
		- Restricted: Protocol allows the password to be numerical value.

	+ Messaging.
	+ Authentication.
	+ Storage protection. 
	+ Sending Private Blockchain Transactions.
	+ Complex documentation.
	+ File System Control.
	+ Security for Sensitive Information.
